This OpenGL work includes a mountainous terrain, rising and falling tide, the sun, the moon and a fighter jet which the user can control. <br />
The terrain and ocean tide are randomly generated using Diamond-square algorithm with new height map everytime the program starts. <br />

The fighter jet model is from [free3d.com](https://free3d.com/3d-model/fighter-jet-joint-european-v1--189655.html) <br />

CMake is required to build the project <br />

When starting the program it may take some time to load. <br />
